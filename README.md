# hello-world
Welcome to my github page!

It starts out with the main page with the title "Hello Sweet-World", followed by the blog page which includes some posts as links, with the first one mentioning about the webiste's integration with jeykyll and ease of using markdown syntax, the second post Names "Miscellaneous" giving some extra information about github.

I've added images as well on a few pages to make it interesting and look nice.
