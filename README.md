# hello-world
Welcome to my github page!

It starts out with the main page with the title "Hello Sweet-World"

Following it is the blog page which includes some posts as links

The first one mentions about the webiste's integration with jeykyll and ease of using markdown syntax

The second post named "Miscellaneous" gives some extra information about github.

I've added images as well on a few pages to make it interesting and look nice.
